# AgentHive — Business Plan
**Version:** 0.9  |  Date: 2025‑07‑19

---
## 1  Executive Summary
AgentHive is a universal **Employee Copilot** that translates natural‑language requests into immediate actions across the tools each employee already uses—whether they are hourly associates, knowledge workers, contractors, or managers. By securely orchestrating workflows in Workday, Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, Concur, and dozens of other SaaS platforms, AgentHive slashes help‑desk tickets, accelerates routine tasks, and surfaces institutional knowledge in seconds.

* **Pain:** Employees waste 2–4 h/week hunting for information or filling repetitive forms; IT & HR help‑desks drown in tickets.  
* **Solution:** A single chat interface that understands role, permissions, and context, then calls the right APIs to get work done.  
* **Market:** > 400 M SaaS‑enabled workers globally; initial TAM focus on mid‑market (500–5 000 employees) where tool sprawl is acute.  
* **Traction (beta):** 3 pilots live (retail, logistics, fintech); avg. 54 % ticket deflection after 30 days.  
* **Revenue model:** Per‑active‑employee subscription (ARR) + premium add‑ons (advanced analytics, private LLM hosting).

## 2  Problem Statement
1. **Fragmented toolchains** — typical employee juggles > 10 SaaS apps daily.  
2. **Cognitive overload** — remembering where data lives + which form to fill.  
3. **Help‑desk bottleneck** — HR & IT tickets cost $25–50 each; volumes keep rising with remote work.  
4. **Poor shift‑worker access** — frontline staff seldom have time or desktop apps to navigate enterprise portals.

## 3  Solution & Value Proposition
| Stakeholder | Value Delivered |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Employees** | 1‑prompt actions (PTO, payslip, shift swap, ticket creation) → save 2 h/week |
| **Managers** | Org‑chart insight, approval routing, team metrics in chat |
| **IT / HR Ops** | 40‑60 % ticket deflection; auto‑triage lowers MTTR 30 % |
| **Executives** | Productivity lift, data on hidden process friction, faster digital adoption |

AgentHive operates via **Ports‑and‑Adapters**; every tool is an adapter providing JSON schemas. LLM agents choose the right port, execute, and return a structured response with audit logs.

## 4  Product Overview
1. **Universal Query Bar** — natural‑language search & actions across integrated systems.  
2. **Action Automator** — transforms prompts into multi‑step workflows (e.g., “File expense for $42 lunch”).  
3. **Context Engine** — enforces RBAC, location, and shift context; shows only authorized data.  
4. **Admin Hub** — connector marketplace, governance policies, audit explorer.  
5. **Analytics Dashboard** — usage, latency, cost, and ticket‑deflection metrics.

### Roadmap Highlights
| Quarter | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| Q3 2025 | GA launch — Workday, Jira, ServiceNow adapters; SOC 2 Type I audit. |
| Q4 2025 | 10 core connectors, multi‑language (8 locales), mobile SDK. |
| Q1 2026 | Marketplace for third‑party adapters; Edge deploy bundle for regulated verticals. |

## 5  Market Analysis
* **SAM (Mid‑market & lower enterprise, US/EU):** ~45 M workers, $6 B spend on digital productivity & help‑desk tools.  
* **Beachhead verticals:** Retail, logistics, and tech‑savvy services where shift + knowledge workers coexist.  
* **Growth tailwinds:** Rising SaaS adoption, labour shortages, GenAI familiarity, corporate AI budgets.

### Competitive Landscape
| Player | Focus | Weakness we exploit |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| MS Copilot | M365 silo | Limited 3rd‑party SaaS coverage |
| UiPath Apps | RPA heavy | Non‑conversational, dev‑centric |
| Moveworks | Help‑desk bot | ITSM heavy; pricey for mid‑market |
| Zendesk AI | Support tickets | Doesn’t span HR/Finance workflows |

AgentHive differentiates via **vendor‑agnostic port architecture**, **employee context layer**, and **rapid connector SDK**.
