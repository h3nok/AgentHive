# AgentHive Framework Integration Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the strategic integration of LangChain and LlamaIndex frameworks into AgentHive's existing custom agentic runtime, creating a hybrid architecture that combines enterprise-grade custom features with proven open-source frameworks.

## Architecture Goals
- **Preserve Enterprise Features**: Maintain existing security, load balancing, and orchestration
- **Enhance Robustness**: Leverage battle-tested framework implementations
- **Improve Maintainability**: Reduce custom code complexity
- **Accelerate Innovation**: Access to cutting-edge AI/ML patterns
- **Ensure Performance**: No regression in latency or throughput

## Hybrid Architecture Design

### Core Components Integration

#### 1. Agent System Enhancement
```
Current: Custom BaseAgent → Enhanced: LangChain-Powered Agents
├── BaseAgent (Interface) - PRESERVED
├── AgentRegistry (Custom) - PRESERVED  
├── AgentFactory (Custom) - ENHANCED
└── LangChainAgentWrapper - NEW
    ├── Tool Integration
    ├── Memory Management
    └── Chain Orchestration
```

#### 2. RAG System Modernization
```
Current: PostgreSQL + pgvector → Enhanced: LlamaIndex RAG
├── PostgreSQL + pgvector - PRESERVED as backend
├── Custom embeddings - REPLACED with LlamaIndex
├── Basic retrieval - ENHANCED with advanced strategies
└── LlamaIndex Integration - NEW
    ├── Document Processing
    ├── Query Decomposition
    ├── Context Synthesis
    └── Re-ranking
```

#### 3. Workflow Orchestration
```
Current: Custom WorkflowEngine → Enhanced: LangChain Chains
├── Custom orchestration - PRESERVED for enterprise features
├── Agent coordination - ENHANCED with LangChain
├── Task delegation - IMPROVED with standardized patterns
└── LangChain Integration - NEW
    ├── Sequential Chains
    ├── Conditional Logic
    └── Parallel Execution
```

## Technical Specifications

### LangChain Integration
- **Version**: 0.1.20 (latest stable)
- **Components**: Agents, Tools, Memory, Chains
- **Custom Wrapper**: Maintains BaseAgent interface compatibility
- **Enterprise Features**: Security middleware, load balancing preserved

### LlamaIndex Integration  
- **Version**: 0.10.43 (latest stable)
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL + pgvector (existing infrastructure)
- **Features**: Advanced retrieval, document processing, query decomposition
- **Performance**: Optimized for enterprise workloads

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Custom enterprise + proven frameworks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Gradual migration with fallback options
- **Performance Optimization**: Framework efficiency + custom optimizations
- **Future-Proofing**: Access to framework innovations

## Security Considerations
- All existing security middleware preserved
- Framework components validated for enterprise compliance
- Data flow maintains existing encryption and audit trails
- No changes to authentication or authorization systems

## Performance Targets
- **Latency**: ≤ current performance (target: 10% improvement)
- **Throughput**: ≥ current capacity (target: 20% improvement)  
- **Memory Usage**: ≤ 15% increase acceptable for enhanced capabilities
- **CPU Usage**: Optimized through framework efficiencies

## Migration Strategy
- **Gradual Rollout**: Agent-by-agent migration
- **A/B Testing**: Framework vs custom performance comparison
- **Rollback Plan**: Immediate fallback to custom implementation
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics during transition

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All agents successfully migrated to hybrid architecture
- [ ] Performance targets met or exceeded
- [ ] Security standards maintained
- [ ] Developer productivity improved
- [ ] System reliability enhanced
