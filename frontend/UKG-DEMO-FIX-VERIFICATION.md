# UKG Demo Fix Verification

## Problem Summary
The UKG demo messages were being triggered but not appearing in the UI because:
- `addMessage` reducer required an active session (`state.activeSessionId`)
- UKG demo triggers before session creation, so `activeSessionId` was null
- When no active session existed, `addMessage` would early return and messages were silently dropped

## Fix Implemented
Modified the `addMessage` reducer in `chatSlice.ts` to automatically create a session when none exists:
- Added logic to create a new session with UUID when `activeSessionId` is null
- Ensures default folder exists (creates one if folders array is empty)
- Sets proper session title based on message content
- Maintains all existing functionality while preventing message drops
